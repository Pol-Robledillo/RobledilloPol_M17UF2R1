## **Game Info**
This is the game I've been working on the past couple of months: *MAGIC LOOP*. It belongs to the roguelike genre, which means that each run that you play will be different from the previous one. Different from the roguelite genre, in this case you won't have any progress saved between runs.

## **Instructions**
Go to the build folder to play the game or check the unity project by going to the Magic Loop folder.

## **Gameplay**
When you start a run, your main objective is to defeat all the enemies in the floor. Once you've accomplished this, a portal will open and you will be able to escape.

## **Controls**
- `W` / `A` / `S` / `D` or `↑` / `<--` / `↓` / `-->` to move the character
- `1` / `2` / `3` / `4` to select the spell you want to use (A spell must be unlocked before it can be used)
- `Left Click` to use the selected spell (Hold if it's the flamethrower)
- `Escape` to pause the game
